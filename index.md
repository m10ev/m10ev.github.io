# "Library Management System"

The Library Management System is a multi-interface software application built as a final course project for **Module 7: Software Development** in the National IT Career Program.

The system manages books, authors, library members, and borrowed book history through both a **console** and **web interface**.

**!This project is completed and serves as a portfolio example!**
